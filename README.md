# Project Title

Neural Network in C 

## Getting Started

The main reason behind this project was to attain a better understanding on how a basic neural network works.
Using this project you are able to build a basic neural network with one hidden layer, train it using a dataset and test the results with a different dataset.
Both datasets are located (/Data/..)
Also, the weights are stored (/Weights/..) for later use on a feed-forward senario.
